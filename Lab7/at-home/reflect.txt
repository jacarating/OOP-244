Reflection:
1)	No, the base class Hero does not need to know about it’s derived class SuperHero.
2)	Yes, the derived class needs to know about the base (or parent) class in order to properly execute the logic within the code.
3)	“Ancient Battle!”
4)	True, because you are creating to objects and at the same time make them fight using the overloaded * operator. 
5)	True, because it’s doing the same logic with the previous code, however making to two winners of those fights, fight each other for a final battle. Following this logic, it performs the initialization of the two heroes, and then a winner gets assigned within those first set of brackets, then secondly the same patter happens again. Within each pair of brackets holds a winner (Hector vs Atalanta), and between those brackets is a over loaded operator * that makes those two winners fight for that final battle.
