1)	A safe empty state is a user defined state that a function recognizes informing the compiler that the object or variable is indeed empty.
2)	In the functions: 
        const char* Passenger::name() const; 
        void Passenger::display() const;
I called the function isEmpty() to check if the object was empty which helped me avoid redundancies from writing the same code over again. 
Also in both Passenger contructors (with the 2 and 5 parameters) I used the *this = Passenger() statement to call the default constructor to set the object to an empty state.
3)	Because  canTravelWith() was declared in the class Passenger so it has access to the private data members.
4)	passName[LIMIT - 1] = '\0';
5)	I have learned how to operate the *this pointer. I also learned how to format the output with the built in method for the object cout using the .width, and .fill methods.
